1. Improve Visual Hierarchy
Headline Styling: Make the headline slightly larger with more line spacing so it breathes. Consider breaking it into two lines with a bolder emphasis on “Creating Professionals”.

Highlight Key Words: Use a subtle color highlight or underline for words like Professionals, Education, Mentoring, Career Placement.

Subheading Contrast: Increase font weight or switch to a softer color for the subheading so it’s readable but doesn’t overpower the headline.

2. Image & Text Balance
Reduce Image Width slightly so text doesn’t feel cramped and both sides have breathing room.

Add Gradient Overlay on the left side of the image so the text has better contrast and the focus shifts towards the copy.

Make Image Contextual – instead of a casual café image, use one showing mentoring, classrooms, or professional growth to directly match the message.

3. Buttons & CTAs
Differentiate Actions: Give Our Approach a solid filled button and Meet Beneficiaries a clear outlined button but make them bigger for better click appeal.

Spacing: Add more vertical space between the benefits (Holistic Development, Industry Ready) and the buttons so it’s less cramped.

Hover Effects: Subtle animations on hover make CTAs more engaging.

4. Benefit Section (Holistic Development & Industry Ready)
Make Icons Bigger: Increase icon size for better visual impact.

Add Short Descriptions: Instead of “Mind + Skills + Career”, try 1–2 short lines explaining why it matters.

Equal Sizing: Ensure both benefit cards have equal width and height for balance.

5. Background & Color
Subtle Pattern or Gradient: Add a light background gradient or NGO-themed pattern so it feels warm and professional.

Consistent Brand Color: The orange accent should be used strategically in buttons, icons, and highlights—not scattered.

6. Layout Structure
Center Align Content Vertically: Currently, the image feels heavy on top; center-align both sides vertically so text is aligned with the middle of the image.

Responsive Scaling: On smaller screens, make the image stack above and text below, but keep buttons in view without too much scrolling.
