Quick diagnosis — why it feels untrustworthy
Over-decorated styling & heavy gradients: warm gold gradients can feel decorative and instantly less formal if overused. The brand tone is ambiguous: is this a charity, a professional training org, or a marketing site?

Visual hierarchy is unclear: several elements compete for attention (large hero heading, bright buttons, multiple badges and large pictograms). Important trust elements (partners, financials, verified impact) are not prominent.

Inconsistent typography & spacing: headings use a decorative serif but the body is not balanced with a clean sans — spacing is inconsistent which reduces perceived polish.

CTAs mixed and low contrast: primary actions (Donate / Support) don’t pop enough; secondary CTAs look similar.

Content problems: truncated email text, odd labels like “2 years old” for beneficiaries, typos (e.g., engineering spelling in cards). These break credibility.

Imagery feels illustrative, not authentic: people trust real photos of beneficiaries/mentors and logos of partner orgs more than stylized art alone.

Priority list (what to fix first)
Must-fix (high impact, low effort)
Add a clear primary CTA in nav & hero — “Donate / Support Students” (high contrast color) + secondary “Meet Beneficiaries”.

Fix content typos & microcopy — correct institution names, change “2 years old” to “Age: X” or “Batch/Class of 20XX”.

Improve CTA contrast & placement — make Donate a bold color that contrasts with the hero background and make it sticky in the top-right.

Show social proof near the hero — partner logos (strip), or a small trust bar: “500+ students supported • 95% employment rate — audited”. Add links for verification.

Recommended (next)
Refine color theme — keep warm gold as an accent but adopt a deeper, trustworthy primary (nav/CTA) like navy/teal. I give palette suggestions below.

Tighten typography and spacing — pair a readable serif headline with a neutral sans for body (see suggestions). Use consistent spacing scale (8/16/24).

Make beneficiary cards consistent — equal heights, aligned icons, full email shown on hover tooltip, make entire card clickable to open modal.

Improve modal layout — reduce top white space, place avatar/name/status in a compact header, make email clickable, use two-column info grid.

Nice-to-have (longer term)
Impact transparency page & PDF (link from hero): audited reports, financials, testimonials with photos.

A/B test CTA text & color — “Donate” vs “Sponsor a Student” etc.

Full responsive audit & optimized images for performance.

Visual & brand recommendations
Palette (NGO — trust + warmth)
You can keep the golden brand feeling, but make the core palette anchored in a trustworthy cool tone and use gold as the accent.

Deep Navy (primary): #0F3A66 (trust, headline/nav)

Warm Gold (accent): #D69A2A or slightly softer #E0A95F (brand accent, buttons outline, badges)

Cream background: #FFF8F0 (hero & sections)

Muted Gray (text): #6B7280

Accent Green/Teal (success/status): #16A085

Use the gold for small, meaningful accents (badges, icons), and the navy for primary CTAs and headings — that balance reads more professional.

Typography
Headings: a refined serif (e.g., Playfair Display or Merriweather) — use bold but keep size consistent.

Body: a neutral sans (Inter / Open Sans / Roboto) with good line-height (1.5).

Sizes: H1 ~ 36–48px (hero); H2 24–32px; body 16px; small UI 13–14px. Keep heading weights consistent.

Spacing & Layout
Use a consistent spacing scale: 8 / 16 / 24 / 32 / 48.

Cards: same height, 24px internal padding, 12px border-radius, subtle shadow rgba(10,10,10,0.04) 0px 8px 24px.

Modal: keep max-width ~760–900px, compact header, 20px padding.

Content & copy fixes (concrete)
Hero headline: shorten to one crisp sentence + 1-line support sentence. Example:

H1: “Transforming Students into Industry-Ready Professionals”

Sub: “Education, mentoring and career placement for under-served youth.”

CTA1: “Support Students” (primary) CTA2: “Meet Beneficiaries”

Replace “2 years old / 12 years old” with either true ages or program-year/batch labels.

Add microproof: “See our annual report” (link) under the key metrics.

Replace truncated emails with mailto: links, with tooltip showing full email.

Hero & CTA — specific layout idea
Left column: headline + 1 short supporting sentence + two CTAs (primary: donate/support, secondary: meet beneficiaries) + trust bar (partner logos or metrics).
Right column: hero image (real photo of students, warm treatment) or a framed photo with subtle gold border.

CTA styling: primary navy filled button with white text; secondary outline in gold.

Beneficiary cards & modal (specifics)
Card: top circular avatar, name (bold), role/age/batch (smaller), status pill (“Currently Studying” in teal), three bullet lines for Course | Institution | Email (truncate with ellipsis + hover tooltip). Buttons: “Email” and “Details” with clear icon only in the rightmost area. Card clickable to open details.

Modal:

Header: small avatar + name + status badge (green check and text “Active”). Close button top-right.

Two-column grid with Academic Information and Contact Information.

Make contact items interactive (click to email, maps for location).

Add footnote: “Supported since 2021 — scholarship amount X” if applicable.

Accessibility & trust (technical)
Color contrast: ensure text vs background ≥ 4.5:1. Use a contrast checker.

Provide alt on images, aria-label for buttons, keyboard accessible modal focus trap.

Add “Skip to content” link for keyboard users.

Show NGO registration number and legal status in the footer for trust.

Add structured data for Organization & DonateAction in markup (for SEO + trust).

Footer improvements
Add: contact details, official registration number, link to audited financials, donate quick links, newsletter signup, social icons.

Add payment gateway logos and security badge near Donate to increase conversion.

Performance / SEO
Compress hero & card images (WebP), lazy-load non-critical assets, use width/height for layout stability.

Use one H1 per page. Use clean semantic HTML (sections, articles, nav).

Use open graph images for social sharing with actual students' photos (consent needed).
