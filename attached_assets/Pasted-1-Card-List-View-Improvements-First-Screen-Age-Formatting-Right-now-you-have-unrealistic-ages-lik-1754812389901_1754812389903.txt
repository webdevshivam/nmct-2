1. Card List View Improvements (First Screen)
Age Formatting
Right now you have unrealistic ages like 2 years old for a postgraduate.
→ Either hide the age if irrelevant, or make it a “Years in Program” or “Batch Year” instead.

Hierarchy & Readability
The current card layout is a bit text-heavy without a clear visual hierarchy.
→ Make the name bold and larger, role/status just below it, and keep course + institution in a clean two-line block.

Information Density
Right now each card tries to show email, education, and status all at once.
→ For list view, only show key identifiers: Name, Status (Studying/Alumni), Course, Institution. Keep secondary details for the modal.

Status Badge Styling
The “Studying” badge is small and doesn’t stand out much.
→ Use a brighter contrasting background, add an icon (e.g., 🎓), and place it near the top right for quick scanning.

Institution Name Truncation
The institution text is getting cut and looking awkward.
→ Use ellipsis + tooltip OR smaller font with wrapping.
Avoid mid-word breaks (“enginernrg”).

Action Buttons Placement
Currently, the email and info buttons feel like they are floating at the bottom.
→ Place them inline under the name or at the right side of the card so they’re not too far from the content.

2. Modal View Improvements (Second Screen)
Age vs Education Mismatch
Having “12 years old” for a postgraduate looks like a data error.
→ Add validation or hide irrelevant fields in the modal to maintain credibility.

Two-Column Layout Balance
The modal splits Academic Information and Contact Information, but the space feels unbalanced.
→ Consider a left column for profile + academic info, and right column for contact + status with aligned heights.

Profile Section
The top of the modal has a lot of white space around the icon.
→ Reduce padding, or replace the generic avatar with a more personal placeholder (e.g., initials in a circle).

Highlighting Key Facts
The “Active” label is good but could be a prominent badge near the name, not in the middle.

Institution & Course Formatting
Right now, they look like plain text.
→ Make them styled as highlighted info rows with subtle background or icon.

Close Button Placement
Currently at bottom-right, which is less intuitive.
→ Keep top-right “X” as the main close action, and optionally bottom close for accessibility.

3. General UX Enhancements
Consistency
The same information appears in both the card and modal in slightly different formats.
→ Show only essentials in the card; keep the modal for full profile details.

Data Validation
Ensure ages, degrees, and courses make sense together (avoid mismatches that hurt trust).

Interactive Feedback
Hover states for cards and buttons to give users a feeling of responsiveness.

Mobile Friendliness
Cards should stack vertically on small screens, with buttons always accessible without scrolling.

Accessibility
Use clear labels, ensure contrast ratios are high, and allow keyboard navigation for opening and closing modals.

If I were to sum it up in one principle:
➡ Cards should be quick “identity snapshots” and modals should be detailed, clean, and balanced — without repeating unnecessary info.
