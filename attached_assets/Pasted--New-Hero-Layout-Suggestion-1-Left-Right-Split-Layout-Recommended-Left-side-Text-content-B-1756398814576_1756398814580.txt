🔹 New Hero Layout Suggestion
1. Left–Right Split Layout (Recommended)

Left side (Text content):

Big bold headline: “Transforming Students into Industry-Ready Professionals”

Subheading: Short, clear mission statement in 2–3 lines.

CTAs:

Primary Button → “Meet Students” (highlighted in brand color).

Secondary Button → “Learn More” (outlined).

Right side (Visual element):

An illustration/abstract graphic (education, mentorship, career growth theme)

OR a student success photo with gradient overlay for branding.

2. Feature Highlights Below (3 Pillars)

Move the Quality Education / Personal Mentoring / Career Placement into a horizontal feature strip just below the hero (not inside it).

Each card:

Icon + Title + 1-line description.

Hover effect (lift/shadow).

This keeps the hero clean and makes features more digestible.

3. Background Styling

Replace flat blue with:

A gradient background (e.g., deep blue → lighter teal).

OR a subtle abstract wave/shape behind the text for depth.

4. Button Strategy

Remove “Partner With Us” (as you requested).

Make “Meet Students” the main CTA (solid, high contrast).

“Learn More” secondary (outlined).

Add hover states (slight scale + shadow).
